<p>For mentors, welcome and thanks for your interest in our software engineering mentoring program. This chapter is aimed at <strong>mentors not students</strong> so if you’re a student on this course you can go straight to chapter <a href="ourmentor.html#ourmentor">14</a> to find out more about how mentoring works.</p>

<p>Before we delve into the details of the course, here’s some background on us.</p>
<div id="about-the-department-of-computer-science" class="section level2" number="13.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">13.1</span> About the Department of Computer Science</h2>
<p>The Department of Computer Science at the University of Manchester <a href="https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/">www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/</a> is one of the oldest in the UK. The <a href="http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/6013/The-Manchester-Baby-the-world-s-first-stored-program-computer-ran-its-first-program">worlds first stored-program computer</a> was developed here in 1948, by the academics who would go on to found the Department, followed by the first floating point machine, the first transistor computer and the first computer to use virtual memory. This history of innovation continues today with cutting-edge research projects like SpiNNaker (part of the Billion Euro <a href="https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/">Human Brain Project</a>) which has built a <a href="https://apt.cs.manchester.ac.uk/projects/SpiNNaker/project/">million core ARM-powered neural High Performance Computer (HPC)</a>.</p>
<p>In the most recent government ranking of all research across the UK, the School was ranked 4th in the UK (based on GPA), and was assessed as having the best environment in the UK for computer science and informatics research. Since awarding the first undergraduate degrees in Computer Science in 1965, the school has awarded 10,000 degrees in Computer Science at Bachelors, Masters and Doctoral level. Our students are sought after by employees, and are active (and successful) in taking part in major coding competitions and hackathons.</p>
<p>As of 2022, our <a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/2022/00560/bsc-computer-science/">entry tariff is A* A* A*</a> with an A * in Maths, and a minimum of one Science subject at A*.</p>

<div id="about-the-course-unit-you-will-support" class="section level2" number="13.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">13.2</span> About the Course Unit You Will Support</h2>
<p>If you volunteer, the course unit you will support is our second year compulsory course on Software Engineering (course code COMP23311). This is a year-long course unit that is taken by students on all of our undergraduate programmes. The course focusses on the skills and expertise needed to be able to work with a large body of code. Students will gain experience of fixing bugs in code written by other people, adding new features to code without breaking the existing functionality, and making larger scale architectural changes to improve non-functional properties of the system - all while keeping the system up and running for its users.</p>
<p>For the 2021/22 academic year, we have a cohort of more than 400 students taking Software Engineering. They have already worked on individual assignments in the first semester, but in this semester, they will be working in teams of around 8. They will undertake 2 team-based coursework assignments across the semester, as well as keeping an individual reflective journal focussed on developing their personal software process, and a final examination in the summer.</p>
<p>As well as learning about the academic discipline of software engineering, students take this course unit to gain key employability skills, to prepare them for interviews for industrial placements and graduate positions, and to allow them to hit the ground running when they do start work.</p>
</div>
<div id="about-the-mentoring-scheme" class="section level2" number="13.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">13.3</span> About the Mentoring Scheme</h2>
<p>As a mentor, you are asked to meet with your team of students twice, to work with a team of students for around an hour each time using Microsoft Teams. The visits take place in specific weeks, during time when the teams are scheduled to be working on their Software Engineering coursework. The dates/times for the visits are described in the eventbrite invitation you have received. Both sessions are one hour long.</p>
</div>
<div id="meeting-agenda" class="section level2" number="13.4">
